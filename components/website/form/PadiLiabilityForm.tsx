                <li>
                  Maintain good mental and physical fitness for diving. Avoid
                  being under the influence of alcohol or dangerous drugs when
                  diving. Keep proficient in diving skills, striving to increase
                  them through continuing education and reviewing them in
                  controlled conditions after a period of diving inactivity, and
                  refer to my course materials to stay current and refresh
                  myself on important information.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Be familiar with my dive sites. If not, obtain a formal diving
                  orientation from a knowledgeable, local source. If diving
                  conditions are worse than those in which I am experienced,
                  postpone diving or select an alternate site with better
                  conditions. Engage only in diving activities consistent with
                  my training and experience. Do not engage in cave or technical
                  diving unless specifically trained to do so.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Use complete, well-maintained, reliable equipment with which I
                  am familiar, and inspect it for correct fit and function prior
                  to each dive. Have a buoyancy control device, low-pressure
                  buoyancy control inflation system, submersible pressure gauge
                  and alternate air source and dive planning/monitoring device
                  (dive computer, RDP/dive tables—whichever you are trained to
                  use) when scuba diving. Deny use of my equipment to
                  uncertified divers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Listen carefully to dive briefings and directions and respect
                  the advice of those supervising my diving activities.
                  Recognize that additional training is recommended for
                  participation in specialty diving activities, in other
                  geographic areas and after periods of inactivity that exceed
                  six months.

                  Adhere to the buddy system throughout every dive. Plan dives –
                  including communications, procedures for reuniting in case of
                  separation and emergency procedures – with my buddy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Be proficient in dive planning (dive computer or dive table
                  use). Make all dives no decompression dives and allow a margin
                  of safety. Have a means to monitor depth and time underwater.
                  Limit maximum depth to my level of training and experience.
                  Ascend at a rate of not more than 18 metres/60 feet per
                  minute. Be a SAFE diver – Slowly Ascend From Every dive. Make
                  a safety stop as an added precaution, usually at 5 metres/15
                  feet for three minutes or longer.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Maintain proper buoyancy. Adjust weighting at the surface for
                  neutral buoyancy with no air in my buoyancy control device.
                  Maintain neutral buoyancy while underwater. Be buoyant for
                  surface swimming and resting. Have weights clear for easy
                  removal, and establish buoyancy when in distress while diving.
                  Carry at least one surface signaling device (such as signal
                  tube, whistle, mirror).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Breathe properly for diving. Never breath-hold or skip-breathe
                  when breathing compressed air, and avoid excessive
                  hyperventilation when breath-hold diving. Avoid overexertion
                  while in and underwater and dive within my limitations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Use a boat, float or other surface support station, whenever
                  feasible.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Know and obey local dive laws and regulations, including fish
                  and game and dive flag laws. I have read the above statements
                  and have had any questions answered to my satisfaction.

                hereby affirm that I am aware that skin and scuba diving have
                inherent risks which may result in serious injury or death. I
                understand that diving with compressed air involves certain
                inherent risks; including but not limited to decompression
                sickness, embolism or other hyperbaric/air expansion injury that
                require treatment in a recompression chamber. I further
                understand that the open water diving trips which are necessary
                for training and for certification may be conducted at a site
                that is remote, either by time or distance or both, from such a
                recompression chamber. I still choose to proceed with such dives
                in spite of the possible absence of a recompression chamber in
                proximity to the dive site.
