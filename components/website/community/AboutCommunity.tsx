                PCH Scuba started strictly as a training organization. We
                didn&apos;t have a retail shop for the first 6 years of our
                existence. We focused solely on training and building the best
                and safest divers possible. Now your community is 3000 divers
                strong. We are so proud of you all!

                Most of our instructors have &rdquo;grown up&rdquo; through PCH
                which has enabled us to keep our focus on safety, mentorship and
                friendships. We&apos;re excited to invite instructors who share
                the same goals to join the team.

                We are always there to support and coach any diver even if they
                haven&apos;t taken a class from us. What sets our shop apart is
                the sense of belonging divers feel when they come to us. We
                focus on developing divers in a non-threatening environment.
                Passing knowledge and tips from diver to diver. Treat strangers
                like friends and friends like family.
